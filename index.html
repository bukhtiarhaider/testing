        <h1>JavaScript Engineer</h1>
      </div>
    <div>
        <p>You know that guy in meeting who always has an idea to share or a question to help solidify the idea he's going to share in a few minutes.. You probably love him or hate him.. That's me.</p>
        <p>I have extensive experience as a javascript engineer working on projects large and small.  From gigantic international brands such as Toyota and Lexus, fixing bugs and building modular AMD components; to smaller marketing centric websites for Paris Hilton, Julius Thomas, and many others needing to be built from scratch with cutting-edge features meeting incredibly short deadlines.</p>
        <p>Technically adept developer with specific expertise yet broad capability, paired with a unique creative outside-the-box imagination, striving only to be of value and improve myself every day.  I'm the quiet guy, head down, getting my work done.  I don't say much until I have something worthwhile that I want you to hear.</p>
        <p>I excel in situations that make others frantic and stressed because I am able to focus on the problem and believe no problem is impossible to solve.  Any obstacle can be overcome with persistence and determination.</p>
        <p>It is important for me to feel as though I am being a valuable asset to the team and that I have an outlet to express my innovative and creative spirit in some manner.  I hope to work with others who work because they enjoy and take pride in what they do and are constantly striving to be better.</p>
